## 🚀 How to Run It Locally

> ⚠️ You'll need Python installed and a [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (free).

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-chat.git
cd gemini-chat
```

### 2. Install the Required Libraries
You can use pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, here are the basic ones:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

### 3. Set Your API Key
In the Python file (`main.py` or similar), replace this line with your actual key:
```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 4. Run the App
```bash
python main.py
```

That’s it! 🎉 You’ll see the Gemini Chat window open.
